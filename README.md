# 3D-printer-sim
A multiphysics engine to simulate material deposition by an electrophoretic 3D printer

This script simulates the dynamics of a 3D printer equipped with a robotic extrustion arm and electrically-charged print bed. The simulation captures:
* The effective material properties of a two-phase molten filament material
* The dynamics of a three-rod linkage robotic arm with constant angular velocities
* The dynamics of extruded droplets of molten filament acted upon by gravitational, electric, and drag forces
